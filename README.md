# NDDL-predictive-coding
Team Parva:

Intro: 
> Predictive coding  


## Todo list:
- Optimize code for batch training
- (Individually) Write out project proposal plans
- ...  

## Possible extensions:
- Supervised learning 
- Improve the quality of the latent representations learnt by the model (Changing architecture, Connecting the two modalities at earlier layers, lateral inhibition, precision weighting, etc)
- Extend the model (Other modalities, temporal dynamics, etc)
- Improve biological plausibility of the model (More realistic architectures, Excitatory/Inhibitory neurons, etc)
